## Overview: OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme runs projects using a structured, five-phase lifecycle that supports both consistent execution and flexibility for improvement. The lifecycle begins with Initiation (validating needs, aligning stakeholders, and drafting a one-pager), then moves to Planning (breaking down work into actionable items, estimating scope, and mapping out releases). Execution & Tracking forms the heart of delivery—work is tracked on a project board through actionable stages, quality assurance procedures are followed at each step, and blockers are addressed according to a defined escalation path. Release & Deployment leverages checklists, smoke testing, and rollback planning to ensure safe launches, and the process closes with Retrospective & Continuous Improvement, capturing learnings and acting on them for future work.

Key roles include Project Managers (coordinating delivery, risk, and communication), Product Managers (defining outcomes, prioritizing backlogs), Developers (implementing and testing features), and QA/Testing (ensuring quality and criteria alignment). Communication is intentional and frequent: standups, weekly syncs, and milestone updates keep everyone aligned.

Quality assurance is built into every phase. Work items require clear acceptance criteria and definition of done, while CI pipelines enforce automated testing and scanning. Risks are proactively managed via a live register, regular reviews, and well-defined escalation paths. Retrospectives promote an improvement culture, with action items converted into trackable backlog entries.

This combination of defined workflows, clear roles, transparent communication, and embedded quality practices enables OctoAcme teams to deliver features reliably while growing team knowledge and adaptability.
